Based on the Device class
https://github.com/fsdtrinings/fsdSep21Training/blob/main/Arrays_Task_3
implements following requirements

1)	Provide switchOn() and switchOff() abstract behaviour in Device class.
2)	Provide Battery to all Devices.
3)	Create Battery class with following properties and requirements
        a.	Int MAX_POWER; 
        b.	Int currentPower; // gives us the remaining power left in the battery 
        c.	Add non abstract functionality like plugin(); 
                 //which increases the currentPower

4)	Create few interfaces like Wifi or Bluetooth and implements functionalities in sub classes.

5)	Create following different types of devices 
        a.	MobilePhone 
             (behaviour is calling , gaming , videoCalling() using wifi , fileTransfer() using Bluetooth )
        b.	Laptop
             (behaviour is doProcessing() ,  webSurfing() using wifi , fileTransfer() using bluetooth )
        c.	Camera (non wifi/non Bluetooth enabled) ,
             ( behaviour is like takePhotos() , videomaking())
        d.	Printer (behaviour is printout(), scanning())
        e.	Speaker  (behaviour playMusic(), connect with Bluetooth() )


Note : create appropriate class structure and display the value of power (based on any calculation, which varies device to device) and print relevant statements
